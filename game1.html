        "sporky needs to travel to RMIT university however his tiny little legs 
        cannot prolong for long distances at a time therefore he must utilise 
        another means of transportation. The available options are a 
        shiny, dazzling yellow car , a cute, resilient, sturdy camel 
        or a small but fiesty scooter. Analysing the code, decide which 
        option is the most time efficient for sporky to get there quickly."
